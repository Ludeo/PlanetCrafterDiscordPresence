# Planet Crafter Discord Presence
This is a Discord Presence for Planet Crafter. It will show whether you are in the Main Menu, the Option Menu, the World Selection Menu or inside of a World as well as how long you are in the specific Menu.
Additionally if you are inside of a world, it will show the world name, the terraformation stage and all the terraformation levels (Biomass, Oxygen, Heat, Pressure). The Presence gets updated every 15 seconds except when you switch the Menu, then it will instantly update the Presence.

# How to install
If you never installed mods for Planet Crafter before, follow [this tutorial](https://planet-crafter.fandom.com/wiki/Modding) on how to use mods.

After that, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Ludeo/PlanetCrafterDiscordPresence/releases) and download the latest zip file (Not! the source code zip file). Extract the zip file into the plugins folder that is located in the BepInEx folder inside of your game folder.

# Dependencies
All the required dependencies are inside of the zip file but I am still gonna list them here:

[discord_game_sdk](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide)

[DiscordGameSDKWrapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DiscordGameSDKWrapper/)

# Known Issues
- When you start the game it might take a few seconds or menu switches till the presence shows up
- When you close the game the presence sometimes doesn't close

# Other
This is my first time creating a mod for a game and also using BepInEx so it won't be perfect, sorry :D Help is appreciated though ^^
